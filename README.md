# [Phishing Detection](https://devpost.com/software/phishfinder)
Phishing email detection for EmP


This project uses Artifical Intelligence and Googles Gmail API to create a web extension that scans an email on Gmail and says if it is likely a scam email or safe. We used mainly two Deep learning models for this project, one, DistilBERT takes text input from JSON file and can return scam or not, and our other model, text-davinci-003 from Chat-GPT 3 (Open AI) scans the emails on Gmail. 

We thank EmP HackFest for the oppurtunity to make this project
